# VERMOS: Simplifying web development

This is a JavaScript based framework with improvementsfor developing and running both interactive web applications and REST APIs. Vermos can run as either a monolithic back-end or as a set of MicroServices.

Vermos framework architecture prevents CPU-intensive or long-running APIs bringing a Node.js system to its knees, and utilizes MongoDB database, to uniquely present your data as persistent JavaScript Objects.

This is the next-gen, fast-track route to Building APIs


## VERMOS is a work in progress

## Below are the components that are in the build:

Vermos Concept, Pre-requisites, Installation, Dockerized modes, Dockerised MicroServices, Definining your APIs, Defining your API handlers, Defining Your MicroService API Handlers, API Handler Module Arguments, JSON Web Tokens, Configuring .json files, JWT Inspection, Node.js Modules integration, setting up VERMOS docker containers.
